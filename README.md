For this to work, it is mandatory that your quest has this installed first:

https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/199 / https://github.com/tverona1/QuestAppLauncher

run it at least once before using this script.


To Install:

wget https://github.com/korenmic/quest-package-categorizer/raw/master/qpc.py


Before running make sure the quest is connected to your device and that adb is installed


Usage example:

$ ./qpc.py

qpclib> pull

qpclib> continue

$ ./qpc.py "find_packages('hearth')"

[u'com.blizzard.wtcg.hearthstone']

$ ./qpc.py

qpclib> categorize_names("Card games", "hearth")

qpclib> push
